## idea 1
**Music Interaction Project**
Input from Arduino is used for interactive gestures through infrared sensors. Different distances trigger various sound effects or music, and these diverse musical elements are visualized as beautiful patterns on the p5 canvas.
One aspect I'm unsure about regarding this idea is how to establish a linkage between Arduino and p5.js.

## idea 2
**Physical Color Picker**
Due to a strong interest in my previous p5.js color filter project, I wanted to create a color picker that allows users to select colors from the physical world and see the results digitally.
The challenge in this project is how to detect the user's color selection in the physical world, and make connections with digital world. (My initial thought is to use different buttons to represent different colors, but the optimal presentation would involve a physically meaningful color palette.)

## idea 3
**Heart Rate NFT**
By detecting the pulse on the wrist, the frequency of the pulse is transmitted to a computer or another device for visualization, allowing each audience member to receive their own NFT.
The challenge in this project lies in how to detect the frequency of the pulse and determine the style of visualization.
